## The **RU**st **C** **MI**nus **C**ompiler

Some inspiration hit after I completed my university's Compiler course, and I set on a journy to build a C- compiler in Rust.

This project wouldn't be the same without help from the library `plex` to perform lexing and parsing, and the library `inkwell` providing LLVM bindings.
